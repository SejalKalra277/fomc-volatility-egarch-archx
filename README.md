# Do Federal Reserve Rate Decisions Increase Stock Market Volatility?
**An Empirical Analysis Using EGARCH and ARCH-X Models**

This repository contains my research study on whether Federal Reserve (FOMC) rate decisions generate measurable changes in U.S. equity market volatility. Using daily S&P 500 returns (2010–2024), I compare an AR(1)-EGARCH(1,1) model with Student-t errors against event-sensitive ARCH-X / ARX-style specifications to isolate announcement-day effects.

## Key takeaway
Rate-change announcements are associated with higher realized volatility, while routine meetings without rate changes show little effect.
